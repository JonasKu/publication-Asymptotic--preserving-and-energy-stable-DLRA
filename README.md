# publication-Asymptotic--preserving-and-energy-stable-DLRA
This repository can be used to reproduce all numerical experiments of the paper "Asymptotic-preserving and energy stable Dynamical Low-rank Approximation" by Einkemmer, Hu, and Kusch. 

To run the code, download and install the Julia programming environment (https://julialang.org/downloads/). Open the Julia REPL (by typing julia into the command line). Press the `]` key to open the package manager and type `activate .` to download and install all required packages. After that, got back to the Julia REPL by pressing backspace and type `include("main.jl")` to run all numerical experiments.
